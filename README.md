# DOEapps 
Creating DOE apps to be used more mobile without coding or software programs (Quick and Easy Versions)
I am working on a few different DOE experiments myself.  I like that I am able to run via python code (and other). 
I also am using statistical software to run the experiments and for analysis of them.

***I had a thought, after using a app to measurement color scales, why couldn't I have an app for simple DOE**
BACKSTORY (building on the above thought, and not the old joke, "you know what a thought did once?"
After a few interviews, trying to get my chemistry jive back, I realized that some companies are way behind with their usaged of DOEs.
Actually, I was really surprised, because it wasn't a new thing, way back when I was a bench chemist.  I know it was my number one goto in my tool belt while working  in R&D /quality after I got my MS in statistics. I was a like a kid with a new toy and I know I annoyed my co-workers with how many I was spitting out.   
***GOALS***
I want both the creation of my experiment and runs and the final analysis.  
I want it to be a simple way to create and run the DOE without needed the expensive software, or creating and running your own coding script.
For analysis, I want a simple anova and surface response visual.  
For one of the apps, I would like to try to figure out how to point to the best reponse combination.
***FIRST ROUNDS***
1. Three choices for the type of experiment
   a. Latin Hypercube
   b. Full Factorial
   c. Fractional Factorials
2. I want a drop down screen of why a certain DOE will be best for your experiment.
3. I am on the fence about the Design space for the current apps, but will include for furture mixture type apps.
4. I want the option of range of values and set values.  (The set values, I need to be able to add multiple, not there yet.)
5. I want to add data back into the app for analysis.
6. Analysis should include both anova and surface area (Still working on including the anova.  I like the surface)

I have two types of apps that I have in my repo right now
One is a straight out of box DOE where you set up. 
Second is based on my windblend doe that I am currently working.  I have the analysis based on the color factors.  So will need to add the other reponse variables that I think are important.  

**BOTH NEED TO BE POLISHED AND UPDATED...working on it.
