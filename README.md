***PLEASE USE AND PLAY.  ALL COMMENTS, CONCERNS, SUGGESTIONS ARE WELCOMED!!!***

OVERVIEW 
Creating DOE apps to be used more mobile without coding or software programs (Quick and Easy Versions)
I am working on a few different DOE experiments myself.  I like that I am able to run via python code (and other). 
I also am using statistical software to run the experiments and for analysis of them.

***I had a thought, after using a app to measurement color scales, why couldn't I have an app for simple DOE**
BACKSTORY (building on the above thought, and not the old joke, "you know what a thought did once?"
After a few interviews, trying to get my chemistry jive back, I realized that some companies are way behind with their usaged of DOEs.
Actually, I was really surprised, because it wasn't a new thing, way back when I was a bench chemist.  I know it was my number one goto in my tool belt while working  in R&D /quality after I got my MS in statistics. I was a like a kid with a new toy and I know I annoyed my co-workers with how many I was spitting out.   
***GOALS***
I want both the creation of my experiment and runs and the final analysis.  
I want it to be a simple way to create and run the DOE without needed the expensive software, or creating and running your own coding script.
For analysis, I want a simple anova and surface response visual.  
For one of the apps, I would like to try to figure out how to point to the best reponse combination.
***FIRST ROUNDS***
Three choices for the type of experiment
   a. Latin Hypercube
   b. Full Factorial
   c. Fractional Factorials
 ***SECOND and THIRD ROUNDS***
 added three more DOE choices
    d. Plackett-Burman
    e. Mixture Design 
    f. Combined Mixture - Process 
***Additional Features***
1. Drop down screen of why a certain DOE will be best for your experiment.
2. Design space for the current apps, but will include for furture mixture type apps.
3. Option of range of values or set values.  ***(The set values, I need to be able to add multiple, not there yet.)***
4. Add data back into the app for analysis.
5. Analysis includes:
    a. Model Summary
      Residual Diagnostic Suite (Model Assumption Checks)
      Notes about the Model
    b. ANOVA Table
       Coeffients breakdown included
    c. Response Surface Contour  ***Still having issues with only the first two factors being used/working on update fix***
    d. 3D Surface Plot ***My favorite part of app**
    e. Predicted Optimum ***Doesn't always include all the significant factors**

Other FIXES or UPDATES that I am working on
1.  Entering your fix DOE runs that you have used already
      a. Curently Unable to load an existing DOE Matrix
      b. Once finish the analysis and close app (or let app sit too long), unable to get back the exact Matrix
          ***Or, unable to rerun the analysis without generating a new matrix, which doesn't line up with the previous one ran.***
 2.  As said in 1, I am having a hard time with the app closing before the experiment has ended and losing my original design to be used for the analysis.  ***BIG FIX NEEDED HERE!!***
 3.  More control over Data entry as mentioned before
 4.  Error popups: so entering things like try, or symbols will be tagged and there will be a warning.
    ***If have errors and not fixed prior to analysis portion, will only get errors and need to start over again***
